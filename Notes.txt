Index01.html Jitters; full file
Index02.html Jitters; as 01 but simpler HTML, still with JavaScript
Index03.html Smooth scrolling; as 02 but no JavaScript at all
Index04.html Smooth scrolling; as 02 but no parallax

Based on tests so far, the problem is associated with the load caused by parallax
Question : why does this not happen with ndtmagazine?
Speculation : problem may be caused by several overlapping functions, all causing high processor load
    1) Parallax
    2) In nursery there is a partially transparent area overlayed on top of the image and moving independently
    3) In nirsery there are several logos overlayed on top of the image and moving independently
Change to ndtmagazine image and see what happens

Index05.html Jitters; as 02 but replace h2.jpg with ndt8.jpg : image does not change problem
Index06.html Better but still jitters slightly; as 02 but remove "Lap & Bounds Day Nursery" overlay
